# nosql-challenge
In this challenge, I analyzed data from the UK Food Standards Agency. 

I imported the data via the terminal and successfully added a new document, "Penang Flavours", to the database in the file NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb. In the last cell of this file, I used code from AskBCS to check the data types was changed.

I then answered 4 questions about hygiene scores of the data in the file NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb.
